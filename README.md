# Clean

This "quick and dirty" code project was done for fun and to knock the rust off of my coding skills.

The objectives were:
1) Create a basic clean architecture that was well abstracted
2) Use SOLID principals
3) Use DRY design
4) Use KISS design
5) Create a basic CRUD API that can be ran via swagger
6) Attempt a couple of popular code tests (Fizzbuzz and Fibonnaci Number at position n)

# Improvements
If I were to take more time on this, what would I improve?

1) Data validation
2) Error handling
3) Different DTO for create Person than Read/Update/Delete Person
4) Adding authentication to the controller. This was supposed to be quick, but a lack of authentication on the controller is unrealistic for most implementations.
5) Pagination to mimic a non-trivial implementation
